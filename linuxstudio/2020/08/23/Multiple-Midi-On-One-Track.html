<h1>Multiple MIDI Devices To (Ideally) One Track (in Bitwig, Ardour, Reaper)</h1>

<p>In this post I compare the three principle DAWs available to Linux with one specific MIDI related workflow. <!--more--> I have a Keystep plugged into the laptop via USB, and a Minilog plugged in via the MIDI controller. I want to play a tune on the Keystep (which is at the desk), record its MIDI, then while the tune loops record MIDI CC (e.g. changing the cutoff on the filter) from the Minilog. Because I use a control surface, I want to minimize the number of tracks (because each track takes up one slot on the control surface). Here’s what that looks like in each of the three DAWs.</p>

<p>The following is the current best of my knowledge on this subject; I’ll update and/or replace this post if I learn anything substantially different.</p>

<h1 id="bitwig">Bitwig</h1>

<p><a data-fancybox="bitwig" href="/images/20200823-04.png" data-caption="Bitwig hybrid MIDI/Audio track - but with only one input" title="Bitwig hybrid MIDI/Audio track - but with only one input"><img src="/images/small/20200823-04.png" /></a>
<a data-fancybox="bitwig" href="/images/20200823-03.png" data-caption="Attempting to add a controler" title="Attempting to add a controler"><img src="/images/small/20200823-03.png" /></a></p>

<p>Bitwig has a unique innovation - the Hardware Instrument track. This is a single track which is configured to be both MIDI and Audio. Even more brilliant, you can automatically configure the latency – per track – by pressing a button to tell it to start measuring, and then playing keys on your MIDI keyboard. It will measure the time between sending the MIDI to the instrument, and receiving audio back, and then will automatically adjust the latency of the track to keep everything in sync.</p>

<p>You can also set up they Keystep as a universal controller; change the channel on the Keystep and the hardware instrument that’s listening to the Keystep as an input on that channel will record.</p>

<p>However, it has a fatal flaw (for this particular workflow) - there’s only one MIDI input per track. Furthermore, I couldn’t figure out how to even add the Minilog as an input; the closest I got was via the “Flexi” controller (added by a plugin), which didn’t work in its default configuration, and seemed to want me to map each CC signal separately (which I wasn’t about to do.) So, the setup I was trying to achieve unfortunately wasn’t possible with Bitwig.</p>

<h1 id="ardour">Ardour</h1>

<p><a data-fancybox="ardour" href="/images/20200823-05.png" data-caption="Ardour - super flexible routing" title="Ardour - super flexible routing"><img src="/images/small/20200823-05.png" /></a></p>

<p>Ardour wins when it comes to flexibility of routing. In the screenshot you can see that a given MIDI track can have as many inputs and outputs as you like. However, tracks are <em>either</em> Audio or MIDI, so you need to pair tracks together to achieve the described setup. (Ardour has an intuitive track grouping feature, which makes it easy to keep related tracks together; however, they still take up multiple slots on the control surface.)</p>

<p>You can set up channel filters on the inputs, so it’s possible to switch channels on the Keystep mid-recording and change which track (and synth) picks up what you’re playing.</p>

<h1 id="reaper">Reaper</h1>

<p><a data-fancybox="reaper" href="/images/20200823-06.png" data-caption="Reaper - track setup" title="Reaper - track setup"><img src="/images/small/20200823-06.png" /></a>
<a data-fancybox="reaper" href="/images/20200823-07.png" data-caption="Reaper - device MIDI input" title="Reaper - device MIDI input"><img src="/images/small/20200823-07.png" /></a>
<a data-fancybox="reaper" href="/images/20200823-08.png" data-caption="Reaper - Keystep MIDI input" title="Reaper - Keystep MIDI input"><img src="/images/small/20200823-08.png" /></a></p>

<p>Reaper ended up using the most tracks out of the three DAWs; however, I’m probably going to keep using it for now (over Ardour) just because of workflow familiarity.</p>

<p>Reaper tracks aren’t specifically MIDI or Audio; you assign an input by right (audio or MIDI) clicking on the record button after the track already exists. I grouped together MIDI tracks with their Audio tracks using Reaper’s folder feature, as you can see here; in the Mixer UI, you can right click and choose “Group tracks at left”, which at least means that the control surface has audio tracks clustered together. Unfortunately there’s a bug whereby it forgets that it’s setup to do this, periodically, and so the MIDI tracks end up appearing next to the audio ones on the control surface now and again. I can get around this by moving them out from subfolders, and to the end, which I may do…but having the MIDI track physically separated from the audio track isn’t ideal.</p>

<p>I also created a track just for the Keystep. The annoying aspect of this is that I have to send the Keystep output to a particular device; the MIDI controller has 16 devices, corresponding to different MIDI DINs, so you can only send the Keystep’s output to a single hardware synth at once, and furthermore it’s not possible to switch on the fly without menu diving. Using Reaper’s shortcut automation, it might be possible to map keys on the control surface to different output routings…I will experiment and update.</p>

<h1 id="current-conclusion">Current Conclusion</h1>

<p>None of the DAWs are perfect in their behavior here. Ardour is probably the most flexible, and if they implemented Bitwig’s hybrid track would get a perfect score.</p>
