# Buying a Pool From Anthony & Sylvan 

We spent $147,000 to get a pool built by Anthony & Sylvan. It has taken 11 months, and there are still unresolved issues. They sent an email asking for a review, so I figured I'd organize my photos in a website with some narrative to explain the issues we encountered along the way.

Overall I would give them 2/5. The end result is pretty good, but the process was a nightmare - we had a lot of quality issues, and had to do a lot of legwork to get most of the issues resolved. If you're going to build a pool, my recommendation would be that you find a local pool builder with good reviews and use them instead. 

Details of the project are below, including a photo gallery of each issue encountered. Here's a quick teaser of some of the issues you'll read about below:
