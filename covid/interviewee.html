<h1 id="joining-the-conference">Joining the Conference</h1>

<p>I use uberconference to do the interviews. We’ll coordinate a time that works for you, and I’ll send you conference information. It will look like this (I’ve blurred out specifics):</p>

<p><a class="fancy" data-fancybox="info" href="/images/interviewee1.png" data-caption="" title=""><img src="/images/small/interviewee1.png" /></a></p>

<p>You can either use the phone number or the browser link. If you use the phone number, you’ll be prompted for the PIN, and then we can just talk. In this scenario your phone number will be displayed to me in uberconference’s UI, so if you care about that, use the browser link instead, and then you’ll be fully anonymous.</p>

<p>When joining with the browser link, you’ll be prompted to give uberconference access to your microphone. Once you have, you can click “settings”, and test whether the mic / speakers are working by talking. You can also turn off your video camera using the button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p><a class="fancy" data-fancybox="settings" href="/images/interviewee2.png" data-caption="" title=""><img src="/images/small/interviewee2.png" /></a>
<a class="fancy" data-fancybox="settings" href="/images/interviewee3.png" data-caption="" title=""><img src="/images/small/interviewee3.png" /></a>
<a class="fancy" data-fancybox="settings" href="/images/interviewee4.png" data-caption="" title=""><img src="/images/small/interviewee4.png" /></a></p>

<h1 id="your-identity">Your Identity</h1>

<p>I’ll keep these interviews as anonymous as you like.</p>

<p>In terms of giving you an identity, my preference would be something like “J.B., 25/M, Wisconsin, US”; we could also go with “John B, 25/M, Wisconsin, US”. If you prefer a pseudonym, I won’t know any different :), so just tell me which you prefer.</p>

<p>IF you are comfortable sharing any photos (e.g. you in hospital), that’d be awesome and I’d love to include them. If not, totally fine.</p>

<h1 id="your-review">Your Review</h1>

<p>I’ll send you a draft before I make it public. Anything you want to change, remove, or edit, just let me know at that time. If you have regrets at that point and want to strike the whole thing, that’s fine.</p>

<h1 id="questions">Questions</h1>

<p>This is not a gotcha interview :), so I’m including the questions here so that you can see roughly the structure of the conversation. Of course, I may add questions if there are interesting tangents to your story. If you feel uncomfortable with any question, we can skip it, and I promise not to ask any further along those lines. I will try to keep the interview to 20-25 minutes, so I may skip questions too in the interest of time.</p>

<p>Please be frank and honest. There’s no judgement here. Your experience will help others.</p>
